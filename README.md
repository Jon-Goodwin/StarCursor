# StarCursor Addon

## Major Fixes
1. Fixed an issue which would cause the cursor to be locked at max size and brightness
2. Fixed an issue where the cursor speed would lag the cursor at certain frame rates
3. Fixed an issue where the options file called a nonexistent function

## I have added some slash commands
/StarColour <r> <g> <b> This allows you to set the color (0-1)
/StarAlpha <a> this allows you to set the alpha (0-1)

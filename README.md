# StarCursor Addon

## Install
click the green code button and download as zip.
Inside StarCursor -- main extract the Starcursor folder to retail interface addons
extract the StarCursorClassic folder to classic interface addons


## Major Fixes
1. Fixed an issue which would cause the cursor to be locked at max size and brightness
2. Fixed an issue where the cursor speed would lag the cursor at certain frame rates
3. Fixed an issue where the options file called a nonexistent function

## Recent Changes

### I have added some slash commands
/starcolour opens a color picker to choose the color and opacity of the texture

### I added a version for classic
This version has an issue with the texture lagging behind the cursor, unfortunately I can't figure this out yet. Though I've looked at some other cursor
addons and they seem to have the same problem, so its possible this cant be fixed in classic.

It also lacks the color wheel because the color wheel works differently in classic. I will try to fix the issue with the lagging texture at least

## To do list

Fix the classic version

Id like to add some ability to set the color as the class colors and potentially save these variable per character

Im planning to add some customization for size and the growth rate of the texture
